                <p>"Coding is an enjoyable process of using your imagination to visualize your ideas and create them with the use of codes — of integrating everything you’ve learned with your own input to come up with a quality outcome that definitely works as you’ve designed it to. In this project, I essentially learned how to create a website using HTML and CSS. I discovered the significant lessons that I need to learn to further understand how technology works and keep up with this fast progressing world. Most importantly, I was able to utilize my critical thinking skills to come up with products with my own <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">style</strong>."</p>

                <p>After completing our performance task, I gained a newfound appreciation for the process of coding and developing websites. I found it fascinating how a single line of code could impact the overall output and create a visually appealing website. Although I encountered some challenges such as the vast array of tags, properties, and techniques to learn, I found the experience interesting yet challenging. Nevertheless, I believe that coding in HTML and CSS can be an extremely fulfilling and enjoyable experience.</p>

                <p>"As I go through the journey of being a STEM student, I have been learning how to create my own websites using HTML and CSS processes. When I first started learning about it, I had no idea why I needed to, but as I continued, I understood how pleasurable and enjoyable it is to accomplish. As we started learning about HTMLand CSS I realized that it is a powerful tool for creating your own websites, wherein you can create and do your own designs, styles, and layouts. I was amazed that with just a few lines of code, you can make your own structure for a website. I improved my understanding of how websites work and how people can create their own."</p>
